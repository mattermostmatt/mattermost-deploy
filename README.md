# Mattermost Interview Project

Please find below, in a step by step fashion, the answers/results of the tasks assigned.


    ‚óè Setup an Enterprise licensed Mattermost server in any of the following deployment
    models:
          ‚óè Mattermost Operator on your K8s environment of choice
          ‚óè Mattermost Preview Docker
          ‚óè Mattermost Production Docker - This one is a bit more involved than the preview
          image but better reflects a deployment you‚Äôd see at a customer
          ‚óè You can request an enterprise trial on our website or through the server‚Äôs system
          console; alternatively, we can email you a license.

For details on the various deployments I tried (all of them), please see assets/README.MD

All steps below were accomplished using the Mattermost Production Docker, with a license requested through the console (the one with the Mattermost and Postgres standalone containers).


    Integrate an LDAP Server and configure at least one group with LDAP Group Sync that you can @-mention within a channel. You can use this Docker image to quickly get
    OpenLDAP running.


So, I tried using several LDAP installations and kept running into weird connection errors (probably something simple) that I couldn't quite figure out. Troubleshooting wise, I tried connecting to openLDAP manually, but had issues making them talk. That being said, and for ease, I went ahead and used a known good online test LDAP server (that I've used before) with sample users and groups to good success. (https://www.forumsys.com/2022/05/10/online-ldap-test-server/).

In the server settings for AD/LDAP, I filled in the following settings and left the rest blank/default:

    AD/LDAP Server: ldap.forumsys.com 
    AD/LDAP Port: 389 
    Bind Password: password 
    Base DN: dc=example,dc=com 
    ID Attribute: uid
    Login ID Attribute: uid
    Username Attribute: uid
    Email Attribute: mail
    Group Display Name Attribute: cn
    Group ID Attribute: entryUUID
    

Once I had that filled out, I tested connection, synchronized, and then headed over to the Groups configuration panel. There, I selected all the available groups in this server(mathematicians, italians, chemists, etc) and linked them.
Once linked, I configured each one, turning on "@ mentioning" and adding each of my available channels to the group.

You can see my successful @ mention here

Synchronized groups in ldap server - . @ mentioned them in the town square channel

Incoming Webhook

Created channel "webhook-channel" in my local isntallation Created incoming webhook in settings, configured for that channel

curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"text": "Hello! Please give me this job. :D üéâ"}' http://localhost:8065/hooks/joze5qowxt8g7pscezzzfef3he

Incident Simulation Task

Still working with the postgres container to get it logging all queries (turning logging_statement to 'all' but not getting anything?), but I dug into the source code and found the line that triggers the query:

getStatValue(stats[StatTypes.TOTAL_SESSIONS]
